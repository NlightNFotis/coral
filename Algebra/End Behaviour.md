The *end behaviour* of a function $f$ describes the behaviour of the graph of the function at the "ends" of the $x$-axis.

In other words, the end behaviour of a function describes the trend of the graph if we look to the *right* end of the $x$-axis (as $x$ approaches to $+\infty$) and to the *left* end of the $x$-axis (as $x$ approaches $-\infty$).

For example, consider this graph of the polynomial function $f$. Notice that as you move to the right on the $x$-axis, the graph of $f$ goes up. This means, as $x$ gets larger and larger, $f(x)$ gets larger and larger as well.

Mathematically, we write: as $x \rightarrow +\infty$, $f(x) \rightarrow +\infty$. (Say, "as $x$ approaches positive infinity, $f(x)$ approaches positive infinity").

Similar for the left end, as $x \rightarrow -\infty$.

## End behaviour of monomials

For a monomial $ax^n$, the degree of the monomial ($n$) and the leading coefficient ($a$) affect the end behaviour.

When $n$ is even, the behaviour of the function at both "ends" is the same. The sign of the leading coefficient determines whether they both approach $+\infty$ or whether they both approach $-\infty$.

When $n$ is odd, the behaviour of the function at both "ends" is the opposite. The sign of the leading coefficient determines which one is $+\infty$ and which one is $-\infty$.

This is summarised in the table below:

## End behaviour of polynomials

In general, the end behaviour of a polynomial function is the same as the end behaviour of its **leading term**, or the term with the largest exponent. So, the end behaviour of $g(x) = -3x^2+7x$ is the same as the end behaviour of the monomial $-3x^2$.

The reason the leading term has the greatest effect on the end behaviour of a polynomial, is that it has the greatest effect on the function values for large values of $x$.

For example, on the previous example of $g(x) = -3x^2 + 7x$, as $x$ approaches $+\infty$, the effect of the second degree term on the final outcome of the sum is much larger than the one of the first degree term (it grows more slowly), so the polynomial behaves like $-3x^2$.

This happens regardless of how large the coefficient of the first degree term is - for large enough values of $x$, $-3x^2$ will eventually take over.
