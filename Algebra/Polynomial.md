A *Polynomial* is an algebraic expression consisting of a sum of *terms*.

*Terms* are of the form:
$$cx^i$$
Where $c$ is a constant called a *coefficient* and $x$ is a *variable*, raised to a non-negative integer $i$.

## Examples

$$x^2 + 4x + 5$$
$$-3d^4$$
$$y^3+5y$$
$$2o$$
$$6$$
(The last example is equivalent to $6x^0$)

## Polynomial Arithmetic

### Addition
To *add* two polynomials, we *add* the like terms together.

If for a certain degree one of two addends doesn't have a term of that degree, we just copy that term to the final sum.
$$
\begin{aligned}
(x^2 + 4x + 5) + (x^3 + 5x)\\
x^2 + 4x + 5 + x^3 + 5x\\
x^2 + 9x + 5 + x^3\\
x^3 + x^2 + 9x + 5
\end{aligned}
$$

### Subtraction
To *subtract* two polynomials, we can distribute the $-$ sign (or multiply everything by $-1$) to the terms of the second polynomial and then perform addition as per usual.

$$\begin{aligned}
(w^2 + 2w + 5) - (w^3 - 4w)\\
w^2 + 2w + 5 - w^3 + 4w\\
w^2 + 6w + 5 - w^3\\
-w^3 + w^2 + 6w + 5
\end{aligned}
$$
