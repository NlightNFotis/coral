A *Polynomial* is an algebraic expression consisting of a sum of *terms*.

*Terms* are of the form:
$$cx^i$$
Where $c$ is a constant called a *coefficient* and $x$ is a *variable*, raised to a non-negative integer $i$.

## Examples

$$x^2 + 4x + 5$$
$$-3x^4$$
$$x^3+5x$$
$$2x$$
$$6$$
(The last example is equivalent to $6x^0$)
