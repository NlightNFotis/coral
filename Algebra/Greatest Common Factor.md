The *Greatest Common Factor* of two numbers is the greatest integer that is a factor of both numbers. For example, the GCF of $12$ and $18$ is $6$.

We can find the GCF of any two numbers by examining their prime factorisations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
12 = 2 * 2 * 3\\
18 = 2 * 3 * 3\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice that $12$ and $18$ have a factor of $2$ and a factor of $3$ in common, and so the greatest common factor of $12$ and $18$ is $2 * 3 = 6$.
