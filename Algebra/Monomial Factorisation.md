To [[Factor]] a [[Monomial]] means to express it as a product of two or more monomials. For example, below are several possible factorisations of $8x^5$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
8x^5 = (2x^2)(4x^3)\\
8x^5 = (8x)(x^4)\\
8x^5 = (2x)(2x)(2x)(x^2)\\
\end{aligned}
$$

## Complete factorisation

To factor a monomial completely, we write the coefficient as a product of primes *and* expand the variable part. For example, to completely factor
$10x^3$, we can write the prime factorisation of $10$ as $2 * 5$, and write $x^3$ as $x * x * x$. Therefore, we can write the complete factorisation of $10x^3$ as:

$$
10x^3 = 2 * 5 * x * x * x
$$

It's worth noting that for any monomial, there are several different factorisations but *only one* complete factorisation.

## Greatest Common Factor in monomials

To find the [[Greatest Common Factor]] for a monomial, the process is similar to the one we use for finding the GCF of an integer.

We simply write the complete factorisation of each monomial and find the common factors. The product of all of the common factors will be the GCF.

For example, let's find the greatest common factor of $10x^3$ and $4x$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
10x^3 = 2 * 5 * x * x * x\\
4x = 2 * 2 * x\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice that both of them have one factor of $2$ and one factor of $x$ in common. Therefore, their Greatest Common Factor is $2 * x$ or $2x$.
