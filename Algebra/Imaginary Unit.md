We define $i$ as the *Imaginary Unit*, which is defined by the following two equations:

$$i^2=-1$$
$$i=\sqrt{-1}$$
The imaginary unit is the solution to equations that don't have any [[real number]]
solutions, for example $x^2 = -1$. It forms the backbone of a new number system called the [[complex number]] system.

## Powers of $i$

The powers of $i$ have an interesting property of cycling between each other. We have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
i^0 = 1\\
i^1 = i\\
i^2 = i * i = -1\\
i^3 = i^2 * i = -i\\
i^4 = i^3 * i = 1\\
i^5 = i^4 * i = i\\
...
\end{aligned}
$$
### Large powers of $i$

From the above, you may have noticed that $i^4 = 1$, $i^8=1$, $i^12=1$, etc., or in other words, that $i$ raised to a multiple of $4$ is $1$.

We can use this property to simplify $i$ raised to a large power, for example $i^{138}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
i^{138} = i^{136} * i^2\\
= i^{4 * 34} * i^2\\
= (i^4)^{34} * i^2\\
= (1)^{34} * i^2\\
= 1 * i^2\\
= 1 * (-1)\\
= -1
\end{aligned}
$$
