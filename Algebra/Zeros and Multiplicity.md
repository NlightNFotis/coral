When a linear factor occurs multiple times in the factorisation of a [[Polynomial]], that gives the related zero *multiplicity*.

For example, in the polynomial $f(x) = (x - 1)(x-4)^2$, the number $4$ is a zero of **multiplicity** $2$.

Notice that when we expand $f(x)$, the factor $(x-4)$ is written $2$ times.

$$
f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)(x - 4)
$$

So in a sense, when you solve $f(x) = 0$, you will get $x = 4$ twice.

$$
\begin{aligned}
0 = (x - 1)(x - 4)(x - 4)\\
\\
x - 1 = 0\\
x = 1\\
\\
x - 4 = 0\\
x = 4\\
\\
x - 4 = 0\\
x = 4
\end{aligned}
$$

In general, if $x - k$ occurs $m$ times in the factorisation of a [[Polynomial]], then $k$ is a zero of multiplicity $m$. A zero of multiplicity $2$ is called a **double zero**.
