By taking multiples of the [[Imaginary Unit]], we can create infinitely more **pure imaginary numbers**.

For example, $3i$, $i\sqrt{5}$, and $-12i$ are all examples of pure imaginary numbers, or numbers of the form $bi$, where $b$ is a nonzero real number.

## Examples

Let's see how we can use these numbers in action. We will examine one of these numbers, $3i$, by squaring it:

$$
\begin{aligned}
(3i)^2 = 3^2i^2\\
= 9i^2
\end{aligned}
$$

Using the fact that $i^2 = -1$, we can simplify the above even further:

$$
\begin{aligned}
=9i^2\\
=9(-1)\\
=-9
\end{aligned}
$$

This shows to us that the fact that $(3i)^2 = -9$ means that $3i$ is the square root of $-9$.

## Simplifying pure imaginary numbers

The thought process we follow for simplifying pure imaginary numbers is the following:

> For $a > 0$, $\sqrt{-a} = i\sqrt{a}$ 

We can use the above, along with the rules for simplifying radicals, in order to
simplify pure imaginary numbers.

For example:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sqrt{-9} = i\sqrt{9} = 3i\\
\sqrt{-5} = i\sqrt{5}\\
-\sqrt{-144} = -i\sqrt{144} = -12i
\end{aligned}
$$

## Why do we need imaginary numbers?

The [[Imaginary Unit]] $i$ allows us to find solutions to many equations that do not have real number solutions.

This may seem weird, but it is actually very common for equations to be unsolvable in one number system but solvable in another, more general number system.

Here are some examples with which you might be more familiar.

- With only the counting numbers, we can't solve $x + 8 = 1$, we need the integers for this!
- With only the integers, we can't solve $3x - 1 = 0$, we need the rational numbers for this!
- With only the rational numbers, we can't solve $x^2 = 2$. Enter the irrational numbers and the real number system!

And so, with only the real numbers, we can't solve $x^2 = -1$. We need the imaginary numbers for this!
