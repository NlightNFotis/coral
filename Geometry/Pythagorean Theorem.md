The theorem states that for a [[Right Triangle]], the square of the hypotenuse length equals the sum of the two other side measures squared.

In equation form, it's
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
with $c$ denoting the hypotenuse (the side opposite of the right-angle) and $a$ and $b$ being the other two sides (also known as the base and height).
